# AntiRickRoll

AntiRickRoll is a browser extension made to keep you safe from [rickrolls](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Rick%20Roll) on the internet.
This works by injecting a warning page whenever you click on a known rickroll link.

Guys, I have NO prior knowledge in coding and i am just maintaining this project (more like adding YT links) cuz the original creator of this superb extension hasn't responded to any issue/pull request (since Jan 2022). Thanks!
